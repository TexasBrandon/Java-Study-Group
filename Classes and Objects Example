//Class and object learning


//Here I am defining a class or object known as Vegetables which contains data on the class or object "Vegetables"
class Vegetables {
	
	String color;
	int size;
	int amount;
}


public class RedFruit {
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		//Now lets use the prior class a.k.a. object within the main method
		
		Vegetables vegetable1 = new Vegetables();
		vegetable1.color = "green";
		vegetable1.size = 5;
		vegetable1.amount = 1;
		
		//Lets take that object and it's data to form a sentence
		System.out.println("The green pepper is " + vegetable1.color + 
				" and is " + vegetable1.size +" inches in diamter " + "but I only have " + vegetable1.amount);
		
		//Another example to help the learning process.  Again, we define a new object with the Vegetables class.
		Vegetables vegetable2 = new Vegetables();
		vegetable2.color = "red";
		vegetable2.size = 1;
		vegetable2.amount = 5;
		
		System.out.println("The beet is " + vegetable2.color + " and about " + vegetable2.size + 
				" inch but I have " + vegetable2.amount + " of them.");
		
		//By this point you should be getting the hang of this. 3rd time is a charm.
		
		Vegetables vegetable3 = new Vegetables();
		vegetable3.color = "purple";
		vegetable3.amount = 2;
		
		System.out.println("I have a " + vegetable3.color + " eggplant but I only know that I got " + 
		vegetable3.amount + " of them, the size eludes me!");
		
		//I lied, one more example.
		Vegetables vegetable4 = new Vegetables();
		vegetable4.color = "pink";
		vegetable4.size = 50;
		vegetable4.amount = 12;
		
		System.out.println("I have a very large and " + vegetable4.color + " cucumber. It's about " +
		vegetable4.size + " by " + vegetable1.size + "and I have " + vegetable4.amount + " of them!");
		
		System.out.println("Yea you heard me, I said I had 12 pink cucumbers, what are you going to do about it?");
